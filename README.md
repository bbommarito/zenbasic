# ZenBasic / NCDOS

A complete 8-bit computer system implemented in Python, featuring BBC BASIC and NinthCircle DOS - a working disk operating system with FAT filesystem. Born from nostalgia and the beautiful madness of recreating history.

## About

ZenBasic started as a learning project to recreate BASIC programming on early home computers. It has evolved into something beautifully absurd: a complete 8-bit computer system trapped in Python, featuring:

- **ZenBasic**: An authentic BBC BASIC interpreter with tokenized programs and memory-mapped variables
- **NCDOS (NinthCircle DOS)**: A working disk operating system with virtual floppy disks and FAT filesystem
- **Authentic Hardware Emulation**: 64K memory space, ROM banking, and disk I/O just like the 1980s

This is no longer just an interpreter - it's an entire retrocomputing ecosystem where you can write programs, save them to virtual floppies, and experience computing the way it was meant to be: one sector at a time.

## Key Features

### BASIC System
- **64K Memory Space** - Authentic memory map with zero page, stack, screen memory, and more
- **Tokenized Programs** - Keywords stored as single bytes, just like BBC BASIC
- **Direct Token Execution** - Interprets tokenized bytes directly without parsing
- **Memory-Mapped Variables** - Variables live at real addresses you can DUMP
- **Symbol Table with O(1) Access** - Optimized header structure for fast lookups
- **Line-Numbered Programs** - Classic BASIC with automatic line sorting
- **Loop-Based Arithmetic** - Authentic implementation using loops instead of ALU

### NCDOS Disk System ðŸ’¾
- **Virtual Floppy Disks** - 160KB capacity (40 tracks Ã— 16 sectors Ã— 256 bytes)
- **FAT Filesystem** - Directory with 64 file entries
- **8.3 Filenames** - FILENAME.EXT format
- **Persistent Storage** - .dsk disk image files
- **Complete Disk Operations** - SAVE, LOAD, CATALOG, DELETE

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install and run
git clone https://github.com/bbommarito/zenbasic.git
cd zenbasic
pip install lark
python main.py
```

## Example Session

```

Ready

> 10 LET A% = 100
> 20 LET B% = 200  
> 30 LET C% = A% + B%
> LIST
   10 LET A% = 100
   20 LET B% = 200
   30 LET C% = A% + B%
> RUN
Running program...
> VARS
Variables:
A% = 100
B% = 200
C% = 300

> SAVE MYPROG
Saved 45 bytes to MYPROG.BAS

> NEW
Program cleared

> 10 PRINT "HELLO FROM NCDOS"
> 20 PRINT "THE NINTH CIRCLE OF DOS"
> SAVE HELLO
Saved 52 bytes to HELLO.BAS

> CATALOG
Files on disk:
  HELLO.BAS        52 bytes
  MYPROG.BAS       45 bytes

Total: 2 files, 97 bytes
Free: 159456 bytes

> NEW
Program cleared

> LOAD HELLO
Loaded 2 lines from HELLO.BAS

> RUN
HELLO FROM NCDOS
THE NINTH CIRCLE OF DOS

> QUIT
Goodbye!
```

## Memory Map

```
$0000-$00FF  Zero Page       $0800-$0FFF  Variables
$0100-$01FF  Stack           $1000-$EFFF  Program
$0200-$03FF  System/Symbols  $F000-$FFFF  ROM/Hardware
$0400-$07FF  Screen Memory
```

## Roadmap

### Next Up
- [ ] **PRINT statement** - Direct to screen memory
- [ ] **INPUT statement** - Read from keyboard
- [ ] **IF/THEN** - Conditional execution
- [ ] **FOR/NEXT** - Loops
- [ ] **GOTO/GOSUB** - Branching

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] **Text Editor Mode** - Line-based editor like `ed`
- [ ] **Monitor Mode** - Memory inspection and modification
- [ ] **Multiple Disk Drives** - Support for multiple .dsk files
- [ ] **Screen ROM Services** - Proper display handling
- [ ] **PEEK/POKE** - Direct memory access

## Design Philosophy

ZenBasic/NCDOS strives for authenticity:
- **Real Memory** - Programs and variables live in a simulated 64K space
- **True Tokenization** - Keywords stored as bytes, not strings
- **Direct Execution** - Interprets tokens without parsing
- **Authentic Disk Format** - Sector/track structure like real floppies
- **No Shortcuts** - If it was hard in 1983, it's hard now

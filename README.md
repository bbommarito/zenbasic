# NCDOS / ZenBasic

A complete DOS-based 8-bit computer system implemented in Python. Boot directly to the NCDOS command prompt, just like MS-DOS or CP/M in 1983. Features a working FAT filesystem, virtual floppy disks, and a BBC BASIC interpreter you can launch from DOS.

## About

What started as a BASIC interpreter has evolved into a complete DOS-based computer system, authentically recreating the 1983 computing experience:

- **NCDOS (NinthCircle DOS)**: Boot directly to `A>` prompt, just like MS-DOS or CP/M
- **DOS Commands**: DIR, TYPE, COPY, DEL, REN - manage files from the command line
- **ZenBasic**: Type `BASIC` at the DOS prompt to launch the BBC BASIC interpreter
- **Virtual Floppy Disk**: 160KB disk with FAT filesystem, persistent .dsk files
- **Authentic Architecture**: 64K memory, ROM banking, proper DOS/program separation

This is computing as it was in 1983: boot to DOS, launch programs, return to DOS. No GUI, no mouse, just you and the command prompt.

## Key Features

### BASIC System
- **64K Memory Space** - Authentic memory map with zero page, stack, screen memory, and more
- **Tokenized Programs** - Keywords stored as single bytes, just like BBC BASIC
- **Direct Token Execution** - Interprets tokenized bytes directly without parsing
- **Memory-Mapped Variables** - Variables live at real addresses you can DUMP
- **Symbol Table with O(1) Access** - Optimized header structure for fast lookups
- **Line-Numbered Programs** - Classic BASIC with automatic line sorting
- **Loop-Based Arithmetic** - Authentic implementation using loops instead of ALU

### NCDOS Disk System ðŸ’¾
- **Virtual Floppy Disks** - 160KB capacity (40 tracks Ã— 16 sectors Ã— 256 bytes)
- **FAT Filesystem** - Directory with 64 file entries
- **8.3 Filenames** - FILENAME.EXT format
- **Persistent Storage** - .dsk disk image files
- **Complete Disk Operations** - SAVE, LOAD, CATALOG, DELETE

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install and run
git clone https://github.com/bbommarito/zenbasic.git
cd zenbasic
pip install lark
python main.py

# You'll boot directly to NCDOS:

## Memory Map

```
$0000-$00FF  Zero Page       $0800-$0FFF  Variables
$0100-$01FF  Stack           $1000-$EFFF  Program
$0200-$03FF  System/Symbols  $F000-$FFFF  ROM/Hardware
$0400-$07FF  Screen Memory
```

## Roadmap

### Next Up
- [ ] **PRINT statement** - Direct to screen memory
- [ ] **INPUT statement** - Read from keyboard
- [ ] **IF/THEN** - Conditional execution
- [ ] **FOR/NEXT** - Loops
- [ ] **GOTO/GOSUB** - Branching

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] **Text Editor Mode** - Line-based editor like `ed`
- [ ] **Monitor Mode** - Memory inspection and modification
- [ ] **Multiple Disk Drives** - Support for multiple .dsk files
- [ ] **Screen ROM Services** - Proper display handling
- [ ] **PEEK/POKE** - Direct memory access

## Design Philosophy

ZenBasic/NCDOS strives for authenticity:
- **Real Memory** - Programs and variables live in a simulated 64K space
- **True Tokenization** - Keywords stored as bytes, not strings
- **Direct Execution** - Interprets tokens without parsing
- **Authentic Disk Format** - Sector/track structure like real floppies
- **No Shortcuts** - If it was hard in 1983, it's hard now
